* converse99 Bio

Greetings fellow GitHub users. My name is Dave Porter @converse99. I'm new to
GitHub but have been using Git on the command line for many years with private
repositories.

My coding experience dates back to the early 1970s on a Burroughs 6700
mainframe computer. In the early days of the microprocessor, I designed and
built a simple computer using a Zilog Z80 chip and 2KB of memory (that's all I
could afford at the time). The whole thing was constructed on Veroboard
(stripboard). The peripherals consisted of an LED display removed from an old
calculator and a switch register for programming and data entry. Coding was
done in machine code directly.

Since 2002 I've coded in Python 2.x and laterly 3.x. Currently, I don't have
any Python projects in process, however, during the UK's Covid-19 lockdown, I
decided to start learning Rust. The main reason for doing so was to effect a
performance improvement on a previous Python project.  All my coding work
to-date has been closed source, but now I'm planning to branch out and publish
open source, probably concentrating on Rust as the language of choice. My main
interest is in command line projects. I guess this is because of my history
dating back such a long time.

My current favourite editor is VIM, but I used EMACS for years.

I'm not currently looking to collaborate an any other projects presently, but
I'm willing to consider any collaboration offers, should they they become
available.
